Followed Waterfall Model

## INTRODUCTION
ASUâ€™s Innovation Hub provides students the room and tools they need to prototype and build creative projects and features equipment that includes a ShopBot 3D wood router, Epilog Laser engraver and 3-D printers. Managing and scheduling of resources is done manually using spreadsheets. As the current system is entirely managed manually, we are working to make an automated application which will replace the manual process thereby increasing the productivity by more than 80% and will also decrease the error rate to a great extent.

Our goal is to help Innovation Hub in transitioning from manual resource management and scheduling system to a system with automated workflows.

We mainly focussed on building the Inventory Management module for the Innovation Hub. Due to time crunch, we had to skip over on machine utilization and lab management and the quoting system as the entire project would definitely take more time than what was available to us throughout the course of this project.

Here are some of the highlights of the project document. [Project Document]()
